Project: EEG_feature_selection

I have collected data from university students performing aircraft flight simulations using virtual reality goggles.
Participants wore an Emotiv Epoc electroencephalography (EEG) headset to monitor neural activity. The difficulty of the 
flight task was manipulated. The purpose of these analyses are to evaluate if there is an association between the EEG data 
and flight difficulty.
